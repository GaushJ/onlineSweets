**What is needed to add and how I will be doing it ?**
> The Cart is needed to be implemented along with the state which I will be doing using Redux library , The cart has been made in the code base but yet to be implemented using react router.
>
**Bugs to be noted and  how I am gonna fix it**
> After logging in the navbar still says sign in , It can be resolved by rendering logout button after checking if the user is logged in.
> Another way I can use authentication is using Passport js or oAuth which doesnot require the user to use share hteir details.

**Features to be added**
> Stripe Integration
